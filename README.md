# QuantumWave

QuantumWave is a small simulator which propagates a wavepacket according to Schrodinger equation using the split-step method and produces animated plots of the scattering process. The program can deal with complex valued potentials in order to simulate complex 1D photonic structures. 

In the repository there are additional tools to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients.

This tool was developed for a Bachelor's degree final thesis.

This project is based on pySchrodinger (https://github.com/jakevdp/pySchrodinger)
